============
Users manual
============

This extension lets you easily protect access to individual files or a whole
folder (and all of its subfolders and files). An overlay is added to both
protected folders and files to make it easier for you to know what you have
secured and what you have not.

To protect a file, edit its metadata and switch to the "Access" tab:

.. image:: ../Images/access-file.png
   :alt: Restricting access to a given file
   :align: center

Following options are available:

Visible
   If you turn off the visibility of the file, this has the same effect as
   making other TYPO3 records "hidden". You cannot access it anymore.

Start and End Time
   These fields are provided by this extension to let you enforce time-based
   restrictions.

Access
   Similarly to other records, this lets you restrict access to either
   unauthenticated, or authenticated users or any list of Frontend user groups.

To protect a folder, you need to *right click* its icon, either in the tree or
in the list and click the "Edit" menu entry:

.. image:: ../Images/right-click.png
   :alt: Editing restrictions on a folder

You will be presented with an Access form similar to the one for files where
you can choose to restrict access to any user group:

.. image:: ../Images/access-folder.png
   :alt: Restricting access to a given folder

.. hint::

   Effectively, when you protect a folder and/or subfolders and/or individual
   files, whenever a user is trying to access a given file, all parent folders
   are checked to ensure the file is accessible with any possible restriction.
   Finally, restrictions on the file itself are taken into account and if
   access is denied, a 404 HTTP error is returned.


.. _why-404-instead-of-403:

Why 404 instead of 403?
=======================

In case you try to access a restricted file and do not have the right to do so,
the logical HTTP status code to use *should be* either a `403 Forbidden` (or
possibly a `401 Unauthorized`) but by doing so, you make it clear for a
malicious user that the resource exists but is not accessible.

We prefer, at least for the time being to issue a `404 Not Found` instead.
