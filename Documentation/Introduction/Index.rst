What does it do?
================

This extension protects everything within :file:`/fileadmin/` based on
associated folder and file restrictions (visibility, user groups and dates of
publication):

Unlike other similar extensions securing the File Abstraction Layer (FAL) of
TYPO3, this extension aims at making it straightforward to block direct access
to your sensitive assets.

No need to configure anything, just install and enable as usual, block direct
access at the server level (Apache/Nginx see below) and... that's it!

Our motto? `KISS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle>`__!


.. _how-does-it-work:

How does it work?
=================

The idea is to block direct access at the server level so that your Apache or
Nginx web server delegates the handling of static assets to a small script
within this extension which ensures any file and folder restrictions are
enforced.

By design, the "_processed_" folder (:file:`/fileadmin/_processed_/`) is not
protected and its content (thumbnails or resized/cropped images) is always
freely accessible.
